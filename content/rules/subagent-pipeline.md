# Subagent Pipeline — Full-Cycle Flow

**When to load this file:** any task that exceeds the **quick-fix** threshold defined in `AGENTS.md → Triage: Quick-fix vs Full-cycle` (more than ~20 changed lines, more than one module, any metadata change, any architectural impact, any non-trivial bug). For quick-fix tasks the pipeline is unnecessary overhead — a direct edit + `syntaxcheck` is enough.

**Companion files:** `subagents.md` (catalog of subagents and when to delegate), `verification-checklist.md` (the closing gate of the pipeline).

The pipeline is adapted from the `subagent-driven-development` skill of [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) and combined with the 13 specialized 1C subagents already shipped in `content/agents/`.

## Why a fixed pipeline

Without a fixed pipeline, the parent agent tends to:

- start writing code before the plan is verified;
- skip structural verification because "the code is small and obvious";
- merge spec compliance and routine quality validation into one fuzzy review and miss both.

The pipeline removes those failure modes by separating **what to build** (planner), **how to build it** (developer), **spec compliance** (parent structural review), optional user-requested code review, and the final verification gate.

## Per-stage rules

### Stage 1 — Triage (parent agent)

Apply the matrix from `AGENTS.md → Triage: Quick-fix vs Full-cycle`. **Only** full-cycle tasks enter the pipeline. If the task is a quick-fix, edit directly and skip to stage 5 with a minimal verification (`syntaxcheck` only).

If the user asks for a small change that **looks** like a quick-fix but the change touches metadata, a transactional path, a public common-module export, or an extension's adopted object — promote it to full-cycle. When in doubt, full-cycle wins.

### Stage 2 — Plan (delegate to a planning subagent)

Choose by task shape:

- **`1c-analytic`** — when a written PRD / specification / area study is needed before any plan exists. Output: a written analysis, no code.
- **`1c-explorer`** — for broad read-only mapping before the plan: locating related modules, metadata, entry points, dependencies, and callers.
- **`1c-architect`** — for new subsystems, multi-module designs, integrations, or extension boundaries. Output: an architecture document with module boundaries and data flow.
- **`1c-arch-reviewer`** — when an architectural design already exists and needs validation before implementation.
- **`1c-planner`** — for everything else that fits in one feature: produces a numbered task list.

The plan must satisfy these acceptance criteria before stage 3:

- Each task is small enough that an enthusiastic junior 1C developer with no project context can execute it: typically 1 file / 1 procedure / ≤ ~20 changed lines per task.
- Each task names exact file paths and exact procedure names — no "update the related modules".
- Each task has a verification step (`syntaxcheck`, an MCP query, an assertion, a manual reproduction).
- Risks and rollback are explicit, especially for metadata changes (UUID stability, register movements, role grants).
- The plan is reviewed by the user. The user's approval is a hard gate — do not proceed to stage 3 without it.

For projects on the OpenSpec workflow (`/opsx:propose`), the plan lives in `openspec/changes/<change-name>/tasks.md` and the design in `design.md`. The pipeline does not replace OpenSpec — it slots into the **apply** phase of OpenSpec.

### Stage 3 — Implement (delegate to an implementation subagent)

Choose by task shape:

- **`1c-developer`** — bulk BSL changes across modules, common modules, server / client procedures.
- **`1c-metadata-manager`** — when the bulk of the change is metadata: new objects, forms, reports, layouts, roles, extensions, tabular sections, attributes.
- **`1c-refactoring`** — dead-code cleanup, deduplication, extraction across multiple modules.
- **`1c-performance-optimizer`** — when the explicit task is to optimize a slow query / loop / posting / report.
- **`1c-error-fixer`** — runtime / syntax error fixing without architectural rework. Use the `systematic-debugging.md` methodology inside.

The implementation subagent is bound by the plan from stage 2. Out-of-plan changes ("while we're here") are forbidden — if the developer notices a real defect orthogonal to the plan, it must be reported back to the parent agent, not silently fixed.

The implementation subagent is responsible for:

- editing the BSL / XML;
- running its own pre-handoff `syntaxcheck` on every touched module;
- preserving module headers, regions and the project's code style (`dev-standards-core.md`);
- removing only the imports / variables / procedures **that its own changes made unused** — never pre-existing dead code;
- summarizing the diff against the plan, file by file.

### Stage 4a — Spec-compliance review (parent agent, cheap)

The parent agent — **not** a subagent — runs this stage. It is a structural check, not a code review.

Checklist:

- Every task in the plan was executed; no task was silently skipped.
- No file outside the plan was edited (use `git diff --name-only` to verify).
- The names, parameter types, return types of new public procedures match the plan.
- New / removed metadata objects match the plan; UUIDs were preserved on edits, not regenerated.
- Module headers (`/// <summary>` or `// Возвращает / Параметры`) are present on new public procedures per `dev-standards-core.md`.

If anything fails — bounce back to stage 3 with a precise delta. If optional 4b is applicable, do not proceed to it until 4a is clean. This is the cheap gate; running 4b before 4a is wasted compute.

### Stage 4b — Code-quality review (delegate to `1c-code-reviewer`, when applicable)

Two important constraints from the existing `subagents.md`:

- The `1c-code-reviewer` subagent runs **only when the user explicitly asks for a code review**. Auto-triggering after every edit is forbidden.
- For non-review-requested tasks, the parent agent still runs `check_1c_code` + `review_1c_code` itself in stage 5 — this is enough for routine work.

When the user asks for a review, the subagent looks at:

- anti-patterns from `anti-patterns.md` and `platform-solutions.md`;
- ITS standards via `its_help` → `fetch_its`;
- BSL LS warnings via `review_1c_code`;
- query patterns, transactional safety, lock granularity, posting boundaries.

The subagent reports issues by severity (critical / major / minor). Critical issues block delivery; minor issues are informational.

### Stage 5 — Verification gate (parent agent)

Run the closing gate from `verification-checklist.md`. This is non-negotiable for full-cycle tasks.

## Anti-patterns of the pipeline

- **Skipping stage 2** "because the change is small" — if it is small, it should have been quick-fix in stage 1.
- **Letting the implementation subagent re-plan** — if the plan turns out wrong, return to stage 2, do not let stage 3 silently rewrite it.
- **Running optional 4b before 4a** — wastes the code-reviewer subagent on a structurally wrong implementation.
- **Auto-triggering `1c-code-reviewer`** — explicitly forbidden by `subagents.md`.
- **Parallelizing stage 3** by default — 1C metadata is densely cross-referenced; parallel subagents on the same configuration tend to corrupt UUIDs and break references. Parallelize only when the subtasks are provably independent (e.g., one new report + one new common-module function with no shared metadata).
- **"I'll just fix this lint while I'm in the file"** during stage 3 — Surgical Changes; report it, do not fix it.

## When to deviate

The pipeline is the default for full-cycle tasks. Deviate only with an explicit reason:

- pure documentation changes — `1c-doc-writer` directly, no plan / dev / review pipeline;
- pure UI test runs against an existing build — `1c-tester` directly;
- a pure architectural review with no code change — `1c-arch-reviewer` directly.

Document the deviation in the delivery summary so the user can audit the choice.
